    "PageRank (developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin) revolutionized web search by generating a ranked list of web pages based on the underlying connectivity of the web. The PageRank algorithm is based on an ideal random web surfer who, when reaching a page, goes to the next page by clicking on a link. The surfer has equal probability of clicking any link on the page and, when reaching a page with no links, has equal probability of moving to any other page by typing in its URL. In addition, the surfer may occasionally choose to type in a random URL instead of following the links on a page. The PageRank is the ranked order of the pages from the most to the least probable page the surfer will be viewing."
